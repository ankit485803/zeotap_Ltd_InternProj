# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Overview
The Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is a full-stack application designed to fetch, process, and visualize weather data from various metros in India. It continuously monitors weather conditions and provides summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. Alerts are triggered based on user-defined thresholds for temperature and weather conditions.



## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - Chart.js (for visualizations)
  - Axios (for API calls)

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js (for API development)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction)
  - Axios (for fetching data from OpenWeatherMap API)
  - Node-cron (for scheduling tasks)

- **Database**: 
  - MongoDB (for storing daily summaries and alerts)



## Features
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: The system fetches weather data every 5 minutes from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Daily Weather Summary**: It aggregates daily weather data, calculating average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.
- **Alerting System**: User-configurable thresholds for temperature and specific weather conditions trigger alerts.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into daily weather summaries and trends using Chart.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up for a free account)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realTime_weatherMonitoring.git

   cd realTime_weatherMonitoring

Navigate to the server directory


## Testing

* Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running without errors.

* Test the API endpoints using Postman or any other API client.

* Check the console for alerts when the temperature exceeds the configured thresholds.
